					This weblog post will cover the courses I took in term 1A at the University of Waterloo. As an international student, too many challenges were thrown at me. Nevertheless, I was determined to study hard during this term. I took 5 full credit and a half credit course during this term. The courses I took are:

								This is a standard introductory computer science course meant only for software engineering students and assumes prior programming experience. The course is taught in C programming language. The course begins with a quick introduction to fundamentals of programming like if-else conditions, loops and arrays. It then covers pointers, strings, structures, dynamic structures, Big O notation and time complexities in various sorting algorithms. Prior programming experience in languages like C, C++ or Java should help.
							</p>
							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								The course contains 9 weekly assignments. The weekly assignments are fun and challenging and require the application of the topics covered in that week. Assignments are to be submitted using Marmoset which is like an online code testing software. Marmoset has some public and private test cases. The result of the public test cases will be known right after submitting the assignment. However, the result of the private test cases will be known only after the deadline passes. There is no limit to the number of times you can submit an assignment before the due date. It is recommended not to use Marmoset as a sole medium to test your code.

								This course is infamous for being a difficult course. It covers topics like kinematics, Newton's Laws, work, conservation of energy, momentum, rotation, rolling, simple harmonic motion and waves. The course contains 10 weekly assignments and quizzes, a mid-term and a final. 
							</p>
							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								The 10 weekly assignments range from easy to slightly difficult and are based on the topics covered during that week. The quizzes are conducted during the weekly tutorials and are moderately challenging.

							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								The Software Engineering batch of 2018 witnessed the transition from MCQs to long answer type questions in the midterm and final examinations. This meant that the examinations were lengthy. However the professor acknowledged this and awarded part marks graciously.

								This course builds on the concepts of circuits you might have learnt in high school. However it is more of an engineering oriented course rather than being a science oriented course. The course starts of with the definition of certain key terminologies in circuits like charge, current, voltage, resistance, power and so on. It then covers some basic laws like Ohms law, Kirchoff's voltage and current law and some circuit analysis techniques like nodal and mesh analysis, source transformation, Thevenin and Norton circuits and superposition. Finally, the course introduces the methods to solve circuits with alternating current and voltage sources using phasors.
							</p>
							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								The course contains 5 labs and 5 CDTs. The labs were conducted biweekly and we applied the concepts learnt in the class to build circuits on breadboards. I found this particularly challenging and interesting. In the CDTs(Computer Delivered Tutorials), we were presented 7 to 10 problems on the concepts learnt in class. The assignments were taken from the textbook and were not graded. The midterm and the final exams consisted of equally weighted problems.
							</p>
							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								<i>Advice: Do not take the assignments lightly. Even though they were not graded, make sure to solve them weekly. This is because the later part of the course is dependent heavily on the concepts learnt in the first few weeks.</i>

								I found this course to be a very hypothetical course. The course starts with the introduction key concepts like subspaces, linear independency and spanning sets using the Euclidean vector spaces. It quickly moves on to matrices, linear mappings and determinants. It then covers eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization and orthonormality. Finally, the course deals with a more general idea of vector spaces which will serve as a review of the concepts covered in the initial stages of the course. It also covers a tiny bit of complex numbers.

								There are 10 weekly assignments and quizzes and are to be submitted in the weekly tutorials. The assignments and quizzes were particularly challenging and intriguing. This however helped during the exams as the level of the mid-term and the final exam was lower than the level of the assignments and quizzes.

								This course is a very standard calculus course. Unlike Math 115, this course is not proof oriented. It starts with the review of different kinds of functions like logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric and some special functions like Heaviside and signum. It then introduces limits, convergence, continuity and some important theorems like Mean value theorem and Intermediate value theorem. The course then moved onto differentiation and the application of differentiation in optimization, curve sketching and approximation. The later part of the course deals with basic integration, integration by parts and the application of integration in finding area under the curve, arclength and differential equation.  
							</p>
							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								We had weekly assignments in this course like most other courses. I found certain questions in the assignments challenging. However the TA reviewed the concepts on which the assignments were based on in the tutorials which helped. The textbook was not at all helpful and I do not recommend buying it. For such a standard calculus course, there are plenty of resources on the internet. Also the notes posted on Learn by the professor helped a lot. The exams was pretty straightforward and was easier than the assignments.
							</p>
							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								<i>Advice: If you are not familiar with integration, try to get a little ahead of the class by learning integration beforehand. This will help immensely as you will be taught integration in the later part of the term and this will reduce your workload considerably.</i>

								Unlike other courses, this course is a half credit course. However the workload of this course is no lesser than the other courses thanks to the 4 quizzes worth 12.5% each, a case study and a robot project.
							</p>
							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								This course teaches ethics, professional engineering, basic statistics, co-op fundamentals and software development lifecycles. I found the software lifecycle part interesting and learnt a lot about various practices used in the software industry. 
							</p>
							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								A major chunk of this course's grade is allocated to the scribbler robot project which is to be coded in Python. This is supposed to be done in a group of 7. The main objective of this project is to learn how to work in teams and to identify what lifecycle to use while developing a project. This project also included a final report which improves professional report writing skills.

							<p class="blog-paragraph">
								<i>
									Advice: Try not to keep the robot project for the last two weeks.
